📌 ESP8266 AC IR Reception + Transmission Wiring
✅ IR Receiver: TSOP1738
(For receiving signals from your AC remote)

TSOP1738 Pin	Connect to ESP8266
OUT (leftmost)	D5 (GPIO14)
GND (middle)	GND
VCC (rightmost)	3.3V

✅ IR Transmitter: IR LED (with NPN transistor driver — recommended)
IR LED via BC547 or 2N2222 NPN Transistor (safer, stronger drive)
Component	Connection
IR LED Anode (+)	Collector of NPN transistor
IR LED Cathode (-)	GND
Emitter of NPN transistor	GND
Base of NPN transistor	Via 100Ω resistor to D2 (GPIO4)
VCC (3.3V)	IR LED positive supply (via transistor control)

✅ Optional: Normal LED Test
If testing with normal visible LED:

Anode to D2 (GPIO4) via 220Ω resistor

Cathode to GND

Edit
[ESP8266 D5 (GPIO14)] ← TSOP OUT
[ESP8266 3.3V] ← TSOP VCC
[ESP8266 GND] ← TSOP GND

[ESP8266 D2 (GPIO4)] → 100Ω → NPN Base  
[NPN Collector] → IR LED Anode  
[IR LED Cathode] → GND  
[NPN Emitter] → GND
✅ This matches perfectly with the code in your ac_ir_control canvas.
Upload that sketch, wire it like above, open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud — and you’re good to capture + re-transmit IR signals!
